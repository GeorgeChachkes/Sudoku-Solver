# Sudoku-Solver
The consistent predicate takes a sudoku grid of any size and succeeds if the grid is an acceptable sudoku solution.
The sudoku0 predicate takes an uncomplete sudoku grid of any size and returns a posible solution that is consistent. 
An incomplete 4x4 sudoku grid is represented in the form [2,3, 4,1],[4,0, 2,0],[0,2, 1,4],[0,4, 0,2] where 0s are unfilled squares.
